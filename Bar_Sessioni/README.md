# 🍔 **My Bar - The Most Suspicious Bar Ever** 🍺

Welcome to **My Bar (sfigato)**, the only place where ordering a meal feels like a crime. This project is a simple PHP-based ordering system with a sprinkle of dark humor. 😈

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Suspicious UI**: Order a **pasto** (meal) and **bevanda** (drink) through a UI so unfriendly, you’ll think you’ve committed a crime. 🤨
- **Session-based order tracking**: Your order is carefully watched, every step of the way. 📦
- **Basic form validation**: We’re watching you. Don’t even think about trying to cheat! 👀
- **Mafia Warning**: Make any suspicious moves and we’ll send someone over. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Specialized notifications**: Get customized, threatening messages based on your interactions with the system. 😏
- **A touch of dark humor**: Every click might just remind you that this is not an ordinary bar. 🍸

## ✨ **Special Features**
- **Mafia Pop-ups**: If you try anything funny (like entering invalid data), expect a “friendly” reminder from our *associates*. 
- **Real-time Order Tracking**: We’ll make sure your order arrives, even if you don’t know where it’s coming from.
